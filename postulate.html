			<span class="quote"><p>Clarke's Three Laws are three "laws" of prediction formulated by the British writer Arthur C. Clarke.
			<ol>
				<li>When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, she is almost certainly right. When she states that something is impossible, she is very probably wrong.</li>
				<li>The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.</li>
				<li>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</li>
		</ol></p></span>
		
		<ol>
			<li>That you do not understand a technology is not an indictment of the technology, but rather is only an indication of your ignorance of the technology.</li>
			<li>Ignorance is the absence of knowledge. Stupidity is the insistence on remaining ignorant.</li>
			<li>When a person states that he is one hundred percent sure of something, you can be certain that they are wrong at least three fourths of the time. The blindness of arrogance is more complete than any other. When someone states that something has 'always been done this way', you can be certain that you will be able to find at least a dozen more efficient and more effective ways to accomplish the same task. Entropy is a harsh mistress.</li>
