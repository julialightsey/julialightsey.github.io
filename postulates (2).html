              <p class="quote">Throughout history, poverty is the normal condition of man. Advances which permit this norm to be exceeded--here and there, now and then--are the work of an extremely small minority, frequently despised, often condemned, and almost always opposed by all right-thinking people. Whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating, or (as sometimes happens) is driven out of a society, the people then slip back into abject poverty. This is known as &quot;bad luck.&quot; Robert Heinlein.</p>
              <p>Although most people haven&#39;t formulated their thoughts regarding design into specific &quot;laws&quot; as I have here, I believe that all experienced engineers have at least unwritten laws or rules through which they self govern their designs. The laws as I&#39;ve stated them here are based on a three decade career as an engineer and developer as well as almost two decades of development on SQL Server and with set based languages in general.</p>
              <p class="quote">A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects! Robert Heinlein.</p>
              <p>If you disagree with one or all; good. Just make sure you are clear on why you disagree and what your opposing or preferred stance is. Disagreement itself is rarely useful just as restatement of problems is rarely welcome. Presentation of an alternative or a solution is where you begin to become useful to others. I&#39;ve presented my positions here as &quot;strawman proposals&quot; if not more.</p>
