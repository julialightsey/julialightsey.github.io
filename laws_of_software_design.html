								<p class="quote">Throughout history, poverty is the normal condition of man. Advances which permit this norm to be exceeded--here and there, now and then--are the work of an extremely small minority, frequently despised, often condemned, and almost always opposed by all right-thinking people. Whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating, or (as sometimes happens) is driven out of a society, the people then slip back into abject poverty. This is known as &quot;bad luck.&quot; Robert Heinlein.</p>
								<p>Although most people haven&#39;t formulated their thoughts regarding design into specific &quot;laws&quot; as I have here, I believe that all experienced engineers have, at the least, unwritten laws or rules through which they self govern their designs. The laws as I&#39;ve stated them here are based on a three decade career as an engineer and developer as well as almost two decades of development on SQL Server and with set based languages.</p>
								<p class="quote">A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects! Robert Heinlein.</p>
								<p>If you disagree with one or all; good. Just make sure you are clear on why you disagree and what your opposing or preferred stance is. Disagreement itself is rarely useful, just as a simple restatement of the problem is rarely welcome. Presentation of an alternative or a solution is where you begin to become useful to others. I&#39;ve presented my positions here as &quot;strawman proposals&quot;, if not more.</p>

								<p class="content">Early in my career I spent some time as a Quality Assurance Engineer at Colt Industries, STEMCO Truck Products Division in Longview, Texas. One of my responsibilities was to evaluate products from vendors and develop tests for them. We would receive products and expected to see both the manufacturing documentation, when it was made and what were the process parameters, as well as the results of their own tests. We would then perform our tests, which were similar to those that the manufacturer had performed. These might include dimensional inspection, salt sprays, stress tests, etc. Essentially this provided an information sharing mechanism. The manufacturer built their objects using a specified process and provided documentation for the testing of a sample batch along with the total shipment. They tested that sample batch and provided details of their testing. We then audited the total shipment with our own testing but would not even perform the audit without the necessary documentation, rather we would simply reject the total shipment. If the manufacturer had not used a repeatable and agreed upon process to manufacture and test the product to ensure it met our requirements, and could not document that they had done so, we would simply refuse to even look at the shipment.</p>
								<p class="content">I worked in 'heavy metal' manufacturing plants, where every square yard of the plant had something that could kill or maim the casual or the careless worker. It was in this facility that a foreman, Doyle Brunson, the most experienced man in the plant, got his hand caught in a press. The maintenance staff worked to try and get him out for four or five hours, as I recall. Finally, knowing they would have to disassemble the press which would be a twelve hour job, Doyle told them to "stroke it through", removing the majority of the fingers on his right hand. Another man's legs were crushed due to the carelessness of a fellow employee. The paramedic was a friend of mine; he said he could hear the man's screams all the way up from the tool and die shop and in the main building as he was responding to the call, even though both buildings were heavily insulated. Many of our finished products went onto the drive and trailer axles of over-the-road trucks; failures had caused accidents, fires, and had killed numerous people over the years.</p>
								<p class="content">In my later career I built machines similar to the one in which the foreman had lost his hand. When I was a Machine Design Engineer and Maintenance Foreman at Western LithoTech in Jacksonville, Texas, a man who was working for me, a friend, had gotten his son on as an electrical contractor. I responded to a 'code red' one day and got out to the location just in time to see the paramedics loading his son into the ambulance. I'd never seen someone that had just been killed. It's not something that you forget. His father was downtown in Jacksonville, Texas eating lunch with vendors. This was before cell phones so I drove down and picked him up and took him to the hospital. I sat with him for the next several hours until they pronounced his son dead. The young man was survived by a wife and two daughters, ages three and five.</p>
								<p class="content">Because of my background in these environments, I approach manufacturing and quality from a different perspective than many of my peers who are also Software Engineers. I realize that if our product fails, no fires will be started, no explosions will occur and it is unlikely that I will have to explain to the widow and young children of a coworker at a funeral why I implemented a sub-standard design. Regardless, we are expected to deliver objects that meet business requirements, to deliver them on time, and to deliver them with the least amount of defects possible given business constraints. A failure of my design or deliverable may not (directly) cause the death or maiming of a coworker, friend, client, or innocent user of our application, but I will lay odds that our client doesn't give a damn, and expects on time deliverables that meet business requirements.</p>
								<p class="content">About eighteen years ago, after about fifteen years of building systems and using progressively more automation, computer aided design, and control systems, I went into software engineering full time. I have applied the same methods I learned in some of the most dangerous factories in the United States as a Machine Design Engineer to my career as a Software Engineer. During that early career I wrote software in a variety of languages, used statistics to evaluate processes, and spent two and a half years on an assignment to build an Artificial Intelligence system for the US Department of the Interior. All of this I apply to my methodology as a Software Engineer. These methods work. These are based on the core of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming" target="blank">W. Edwards Deming's</a> processes, and on hard earned experience that I gained through my failures, my successes, or through working with mentors during my early career.</p>

									<li>That you do not understand a technology is not an indictment of the technology, but rather is only an indication of your ignorance of the technology.</li>
									<li>Ignorance is the absence of knowledge. Stupidity is the insistence on remaining ignorant.</li>
									<li>When a person states that he is one hundred percent sure of something, you can be certain that they are wrong at least three fourths of the time. The blindness of arrogance is more complete than any other. When someone states that something has &#39;always been done this way&#39;, you can be certain that you will be able to find at least a dozen more efficient and more effective ways to accomplish the same task.
