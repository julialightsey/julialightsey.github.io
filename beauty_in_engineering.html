								<p class="quote">The Beechcraft Model 17, popularly known as the "Staggerwing" was first flown on November 4, 1932. During its heyday it was used as an executive aircraft, much as the private jet is now.</p>
								<p class="quote">The Model 17's unusual negative stagger wing configuration and unique shape maximized pilot visibility while negligibly reducing interference between the wings. The fabric-coveredfuselage was faired with wood formers and stringers over a welded, steel tube frame.</p>
								<p class="content">Within my design philosophy, and indeed within my philosophy on life, there are no mistakes. There are decisions and situations which yield undesirable results. All decisions yield unpredictable and unexpected results within a range, just as all zebras share an unpredictable pattern of stripes, but within the range that is unmistakably "zebra". However some decisions or situations yield results far out of the acceptable range.</p>
								<p class="content">These are opportunities for improvement and for learning. Theoretically it would be a "mistake" if this situation or decision were repeated, but my design philosophy, based as it is on deterministic chaos and the process of continuous improvement, simply does not allow me to consider repeating actions that put me in a "failure" situation. Repeating a course of action and expecting different results is the classic definition of insanity, and I don't base my philosophy on insanity! Sound engineering and design practices result in the unmistakable mark of beauty.</p>

								<p class="content">In order to use the principles of Continuous Improvement you must accept that change needs to occur. In manufacturing this became obvious in the decades of the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's when the USA was being overwhelmed by goods of superior quality and lesser price. This need for continuous improvement continues today as the US market faces competition from all parts of the globe, much of which has also embraced these same principles.</p>
								<p class="content">The need for improvement is not quite as obvious in the world of business software. Since much of the software written is unique within that company there can be no concerted effort at competition. In these quarters management often relies on individuals to make the decision about what, if any, changes should be made. When these individuals are chosen based on charlatanry or nepotistic practices the result is that talented individuals are often driven out, ostracized, attacked, and despised.</p>
								<p class="quote">Throughout history, poverty is the normal condition of man. Advances which permit this norm to be exceeded--here and there, now and then--are the work of an extremely small minority, frequently despised, often condemned, and almost always opposed by all right-thinking people. Whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating, or (as sometimes happens) is driven out of a society, the people then slip back into abject poverty. This is known as "bad luck". Robert Heinlein.</p>
