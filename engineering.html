								<p class="quote">I reject your reality and substitute my own. - Jeffrey Byron (as Paul Bradford in The Dungeonmaster).</p>
								<p class="content"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory" target="blank">Chaos theory</a> studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, an effect which is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions ... yield widely diverging outcomes ..., rendering long-term prediction impossible in general. This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos.
								</p>
								<p class="content">Fractals are an artifact of deterministic chaos. These can be observed in nature as the stripes on a zebra, snowflakes, and fingerprints; each is easily classified in its respective element, yet each is completely unique within that element. Trees are an example of a natural occurrence of a fractal. An oak tree will never be mistaken for a beech, yet each oak tree is completely unique within the set of all the oak trees that exist now and have existed in the past. Each leaf on each oak tree is completely unique yet immediately recognizable as an oak leaf.</p>
								<p class="content">If you have ever seen a tree heal a wound (see [compartmentalization_and_barrier_zones] below) where it has lost a branch due to pruning or perhaps a storm you have seen the true strength of the tree; a tree specifically, but more generally a fractal or deterministic chaos. While there is an underlying formula in its DNA that generates and governs the dynamics of the cells that become the tree, that formula operates in deterministic chaos thereby allowing the tree to adapt to its conditions and survive incredible damage. This adaptation might be thought of as Darwinian selection in action.</p>
								<p class="content">Using deterministic chaos as an allegory for a design methodology may seem strange at first, but compare a species of tree to a type of manufactured product such as an automobile. For an automobile the pinnacle of design, perfection, and beauty is consistency in a form which must be constantly maintained and improved. Contrast that to each tree which is completely unique while being perfectly matched to its surroundings and requiring no maintenance. Improvement comes gradually and as required due to constant change and growth.
								</p>
								<p class="content">In manufacturing this process is the methodology known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_improvement" target="blank">Continuous Improvement (CIP)</a> or Kaizen:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The core principle of CIP is the (self) reflection of processes. (Feedback)</li>
									<li>The purpose of CIP is the identification, reduction, and elimination of suboptimal processes. (Efficiency)</li>
									<li>The emphasis of CIP is on incremental, continual steps rather than giant leaps. (Evolution)</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="content">The principles of Continuous Improvement are neither fictitious nor are they fantasy based. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming" target="blank">W.E. Deming</a> developed these principles in post-war Japan where they were perfected to the point that it was necessary to bring them to the USA so we could compete with products coming to the US from Japan! As a young engineer in the 1980's I studied the work of both Deming and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Juran" target="blank">J.M. Juran</a> extensively and implemented them both in the manufacture of physical products as well as the methodology of design. For years both Machinery's Handbook and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jurans-Quality-Control-Handbook-Juran/dp/0070331766" target="blank">Juran's Quality Control Handbook</a> were indispensable reference works for me. By applying these principles in my professional life I have attained a level of skill which is rarely challenged, but not because I'm the smartest person in the room. I have reached my level of skill because I have always believed and continue to believe that I can always improve myself and I always question my own work.</p>

While management has finally begun to adopt the agile methodologies, it is all too often forgotten that technical excellence, good design, simplicity, and adaptation are core principles.</p>
								<p class="content"><a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="blank">The Agile Manifesto</a> is based on twelve principles:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software</li>
									<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development</li>
									<li>Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)</li>
									<li>Working software is the principal measure of progress</li>
									<li>Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace</li>
									<li>Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers</li>
									<li>Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)</li>
									<li>Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted</li>
									<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design</li>
									<li>Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential</li>
									<li>Self-organizing teams</li>
									<li>Regular adaptation to changing circumstances</li>

								<p class="quote">At first glance, the key and the lock it fits may seem very different. Different in shape, different in function, different in design. The man who looks at them without knowledge of their true nature might think them opposites, for one is meant to open, and the other to keep closed. yet, upon closer examination, he might see that without one, the other becomes useless. The wise man then sees that both lock and key were created for the same purpose. Sazed, Brian Sanderson, The Well of Ascension: Book Two of Mistborn.</p>

									<h3>[compartmentalization_and_barrier_zones]</h3>
								</a>
								<p class="quote">Trees respond to wounding or injury in two ways: compartmentalization and the development of barrier zones (Shigo 1986).</p>
								<p class="quote"><u>Compartmentalization</u> - When a tree is wounded, the injured tissue is not repaired and does not heal. Trees do not heal; they seal. If you look at an old wound, you will notice that it does not “heal” from the inside out, but eventually the tree covers the opening by forming specialized “callus” tissue around the edges of the wound. After wounding, new wood growing around the wound forms a protective boundary preventing the infection or decay from spreading into the new tissue. Thus, the tree responds to the injury by “compartmentalizing” or isolating the older, injured tissue with the gradual growth of new, healthy tissue.</p>
								<p class="quote"><u>Barrier Zones</u> - Not only do trees try to close the damaged tissue from the outside, they also make the existing wood surrounding the wound unsuitable for spread of decay organisms. Although these processes are not well understood, the tree tries to avoid further injury by setting chemical and physical boundaries around the infected cells, reacting to the pathogen and confining the damage.</p>
								<p class="quote">If the tree is fast and effective with its boundary-setting mechanisms, the infection remains localized and does not spread. However, if the boundary-setting mechanisms are not effective, the infection will spread. Most vigorous or actively growing trees are fairly successful in coping with decay-spreading mechanisms.
								</p>
								<p class="content">When designing a system, using the natural process of compartmentalization and barrier zones as do trees is a sound approach. In software this is often referred to as avoiding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_brittleness" target="blank">brittle</a> designs while favoring a malleable or loosely coupled design. Simultaneously, using the design patterns of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern" target="blank">facade</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern" target="blank">adaptor</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern" target="blank">decorator</a> provide what is analogous to barrier zones. 
								</p>
								<p class="content">It is unusual for design patterns to be referenced in the context of the language of SQL or a relational database. This is a mistake.

									<h3>[laws_of_software_design]</h3>

								<p class="quote">Throughout history, poverty is the normal condition of man. Advances which permit this norm to be exceeded--here and there, now and then--are the work of an extremely small minority, frequently despised, often condemned, and almost always opposed by all right-thinking people. Whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating, or (as sometimes happens) is driven out of a society, the people then slip back into abject poverty. This is known as &quot;bad luck&quot;. Robert Heinlein.</p>
								<p class="content">
									<a href="./laws_of_software_design.html" target="_top">Katherine&#39;s Laws of Software Design</a> - Although most people haven&#39;t formulated their thoughts regarding design into specific &quot;laws&quot; as I have here, I believe that all experienced engineers have at least unwritten laws or rules through which they self govern their designs. The laws as I&#39;ve stated them here are based on a three decade career as an engineer and developer as well as almost two decades of development on SQL Server and with set based languages in general.

								<p class="quote">A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects! Robert Heinlein.</p>
								<p class="content">If you disagree with one or all; good. Just make sure you are clear on why you disagree and what your opposing or preferred stance is. Disagreement itself is rarely useful just as restatement of problems is rarely welcome. Presentation of an alternative or a solution is where you begin to become useful to others. I&#39;ve presented my positions here as &quot;strawman proposals&quot; if not more.</p>

									<h3>[heterogeneity]</h3>
								</a>
								<p class="quote">This divorce of art from technology is completely unnatural. Robert M. Pirsig.</p>
								<p class="content">I cannot find the lines dividing engineering, art, truth, spirituality, beauty, love, and life. I see the world as heterogeneous but as a whole, as having phases as different as that of gas, liquid, and solid, but like water, still being of the same.</p>
								<p class="quote">Separating art from engineering does not improve the engineer, rather it lessens her by removing a possible point of reference. Separating spirituality from truth strengthens neither the pilgrim nor the philosopher, it only takes from each a means of understanding the other.
