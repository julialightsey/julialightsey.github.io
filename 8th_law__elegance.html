									Complexity must justify itself.
								</p>
								<p class="quote">Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. Antoine-Marie-Roger de Saint-Exupery, Wind, Sand and Stars.</p>
								<p class="content">In the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary, the simplest solution is always preferable. YAGNI (You aren&#39;t going to need it) is the principle behind the agile methodology practice of &quot;do the simplest thing that could possibly work.&quot; Additional functionality is only added as the business requirement demands it. If you write code properly, with unit tests to validate required functionality, additional features can be added ad hoc in the future without fear that existing functionality will be compromised.</p>
								<p class="quote">One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple. Jack Kerouac, The Dharma Bums.</p>
								<p class="content">An engineer should always seek to reduce complexity. We build things, software or physical, to meet a specific business need. The simplest possible code, properly unit tested, is always preferably. Unnecessarily adding complexity to an object is a preference, not a requirement.</p>
								<p class="quote">That&#39;s been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it&#39;s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains. Steve Jobs.</p>
								<p class="content">Most systems are comprised of multiple tests, constraints, rules, guidelines, or laws. The reason for this is that few systems are so simple that they can be adequately defined on only one dimension. Such is the case with these laws. It is easy to run headlong down the path of others of these laws and build systems or objects that are highly complex. Sometimes this is justified. Building complexity within an object to abstract it away from the public interface is a logical and defensible objective. Regardless, the complexity must always justify itself. There must be a rational reason why this complexity exists. It is not enough that it is cool, trendy, elegant, or fun to write.</p>
								<p class="content">You must always be ready to explain why you use a technique, tool, or process in light of other potentially less complex solutions or tools. Referring to other laws in this set, you should also design and build objects that allow refactoring, that are easy to understand, and that are fully tested. Doing so will allow you to remove or replace complexity without compromising the business objectives.</p>
