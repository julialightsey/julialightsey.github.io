								<h3>[4th_law__objectives]</h3>
								<p class="navigation"><a href="#top">back to top...</a></p>
								<p class="content" style="text-align:center;">If you have no objectives, you cannot meet them; if you have no principles, it will not matter if you do.</p>
								<p class="quote">First, have a definite, clear practical ideal; a goal, an objective. Second, have the necessary means to achieve your ends; wisdom, money, materials, and methods. Third, adjust all your means to that end. Aristotle.</p>
								<p class="content">Your time is better spent writing tests for and refactoring objects with known methods than it is chasing the oft encountered demand to "build it till I like it!" Insist on having clear and obtainable objectives before you begin a task, even if your only objective is simply to help the orderer define objectives!.</p>
								<p class="quote">We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. John F. Kennedy.</p>
								<p class="content">When in doubt, demand that you be provided with or be allowed to build unit tests which must be agreed on before beginning development. You won't be popular for insisting on this, at first. After you've proven that you can consistently hit deadlines within constraints you'll be a hero. Just keep in mind that hero's often die horrible deaths.</p>
								<p class="content">Every project I've ever been on that was successful was one where the objectives were clearly identified and agreed upon. Every project I've ever been on that was unsuccessful has been one where the objectives were in doubt, unstated, or in which there was no agreement on objectives.</p>
								<p class="content">Every meeting I've ever been in that had no objectives was an exercise in futility. I have often asked at the beginning of a meeting, "Why are we here? What is the objective for the meeting?" I have often refused to attend meetings where the meeting notice was blank, insisting on having a purpose, agenda, and desired objective and outcome of the meeting before committing time to it.</p>
								<p class="quote">It's not enough to be busy, so are the ants. The question is, what are we busy about? Henry David Thoreau.</p>
								<p class="content">As a young engineer for Colt Industries in the 1980's, the policy was that the agenda for a meeting had to be sent out a week in advance, the maximum length was thirty minutes, and the meeting must begin or be cancelled no later than five minutes past the advertised start time. I came to meetings prepared.</p>
								<p class="content">If you find yourself working on a task where the objective is stated as, "Build it till I like it," or something similarly arrogant, an updated resume may be your best recourse. Few people arrogant enough to refuse to give objectives are willing to change. There may be an opportunity to educate them, but you will rarely lose money betting that arrogant people will remain so.</p>
								<p class="content">Similarly, just because you have an objective doesn't mean that it's either a valid and attainable objective or that you have a right to use whatever means necessary to meet it.</p>
								<p class="quote">Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That's what's insane about it. John Lennon.</p>
								<p class="content">Refer to the <a href=".\unit_test.html" target="blank">unit test</a> demonstrated here. The objectives are both well defined and well constrained. There is no valid reason that you cannot either be provided with this type of definition for your objectives or allowed to build and submit that definition for approval prior to beginning to work.</p>
								<p class="content">There are of course innumerable invalid reasons that you will not be provided with this or allowed to develop and submit it for approval. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five#Literary_techniques" target="blank">So it goes</a>.</p>
