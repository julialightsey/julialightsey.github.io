								<p class="content">I understand the underlying architecture of SQL Server (and most modern relational databases) as well as the next geeky girl, but that doesn't mean that I believe that some esoteric technique that is appropriate for serving up terabytes of data hourly is appropriate for your tiny little database serving up megabytes per day. If you cannot show conclusively that a specific technique performs better on your application using relevant mathematical techniques but still insist on using it then you fall into the same category as teenagers who bolt huge racing tires and loud mufflers on their tiny little four cylinder eco-cars.</p>

								<p class="content">Performance problems do occur in systems of any size, and typically occur due to structural issues. Design a system using encapsulation, asynchronous behavior, and loose coupling, and you'll be able to spot and address performance issues. That does not mean that performance modifications are a must have on every design.</p>
								<p class="quote">The Zeppelin D.I, or Zeppelin-Lindau D.I or Zeppelin D.I (Do) (as named in German documents) was also sometimes referred postwar as the Dornier D.I or Dornier-Zeppelin D.I for the designer, was a single-seat all-metal stressed skin monocoque cantilever-wing biplane fighter developed by Claude Dornierwhile working for Luftschiffbau Zeppelin at their Lindau facility... it was the first fighter to feature such construction and although production was cancelled prior to the completion of any production versions it was also the first aircraft with these features to go into production.</p>
								<p class="quote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stressed_skin" target="blank">Stressed skin</a> is a type of rigid construction, intermediate between monocoque and a rigid frame with a non-loaded covering. A stressed skin structure has its compression-taking elements localized and its tension-taking elements distributed... A framework box can be distorted from being square, so it isn't rigid by itself, however adding diagonals that take either tension or compression fixes this, because the box cannot deviate from right angles without altering the diagonals. Sometimes flexible members like wires are used to provide tension, or rigid compression frames are used, as with a Warren or Pratt truss, however both these are full frame structures. When the skin or outer covering is in tension so that it provides a significant portion of the rigidity, the structure is said to have a stressed skin design. This may also be referred to as semi-monocoque, and overlaps with monocoque, which has less framing, sometimes only including longitudinal or lateral members and also overlaps with rigid frame structures where a minor portion of the overall stiffness may be derived from the skin. This method of construction is lighter than a full frame structure and not as complex to design as a full monocoque.</p>
								<p class="content">As engineers and developers it is easy to build objects that do things we'd like them to do rather than which meet business objectives. One way we manage that is with the Fourth Law. Another technique is through the application of the Third Law. The Seventh Lawspeaks to the requirement for facts. Software Engineering is in great part art rather than a science. Software cannot be fully defined by either Newtonian or Einsteinian physics. Instead, a software design or object is a fractal, defined by Chaos Theory. Often, the only way we can fully constrain and define the result of a design or of an object is through a test. In the case of software this is commonly referred to as a unit test. </p>
								<p class="content">if you cannot effectively, repeatably, programmatically, and fully test an object, not only is it too complex, you cannot even prove that it meets the business requirement. If you cannot prove that it meets the business requirements, you should not even bother to build it.</p>
