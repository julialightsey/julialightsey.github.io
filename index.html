								<p class="content">I spent several years developing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree" target="blank">b-tree database</a> in ANSI C during the late 1980's, using statistical methods to build an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system" target="blank">expert system</a> on top of that database for decision support for the <a href="https://www.osmre.gov/" target="blank">Office of Surface Mining</a>. Later, I spent years writing Java and C# code against both SQL Server and Oracle Database, and became quite enamored of object oriented (OO) programming and design.
								</p>
								<p class="content">I found that I became more involved with SQL programming as a language, and with SQL Server as a platform. I remain impressed with the simplicity of the language relative to its power and potential sophistication.

								<p class="quote">I believe that most of the bad SQL queries in the world are the result of bad schema design. Joe Celko, SQL Programming Style.</p>
								<p class="content">But SQL is a language that allows the uninformed to build incredibly bad architectures. Designs that run well in boardroom presentations fail catastrophically when put under production load as data builds up.</p>
