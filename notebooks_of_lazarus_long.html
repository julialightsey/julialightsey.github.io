							<p class="content">By: Robert Heinlein
							<p class="content"><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/or/sociologyshop/fairuse.html">Fair Use</a>
							<p class="content">The following "aphorisms" come from the "Notebooks of Lazarus Long" in Robert Heinlein's 1973 novel, <u>Time Enough for Love</u>.  These notebooks are called "Intermission" (pp. 240-251) and "Second Intermission" (pp. 346-353) and are full of pithy insights and opinions of Lazarus Long, the central character in this classic science fiction novel.  Some of the aphorisms can be readily agreed with...while others might provoke disagreement.  Yet, all of them generate thought about our own time (my own personal standard concerning "science fiction").    They are presented here in that spirit...thought-provoking observations from an author, Heinlein, who has never been bereft of such insights in any book he has written...and who never forgot <i>who</i> he was writing for...and <i>when</i>.

But the contradictions go deeper than this prima-facie 			absurdity. In declaring his love for a beaver damn (erected by beavers for beaver&quot;s purposes) and his hatred 			for dams erected by men (for the purpose of men) the &quot;Naturist&quot; reveals his hatred for his own race--i.e., his 		own self-hatred.
							</p>
							<p class="content">In the case of &quot;Naturists&quot; such self&quot;hatred is understandable; they are such a sorry lot. But hatred is too strong an emotion to feel toward them; pity and contempt are the most they rate.
							</p>
							<p class="content">As for me, willy-nilly I am a man, not a beaver, and H. Sapiens is the only race I have or can have. Fortunately for me, I like being part of a race made up of men and women-- it strikes me as a fine arrangement and perfectly &quot;natural.&quot;  Believe it or not, there were &quot;Naturists&quot; who opposed the first flight 	to old Earth&quot;s Moon as being &quot;unnatural&quot; and a &quot;despoiling of nature.&quot;

							<p class="content">No man is an island--&quot; Much as we may feel and act as individuals, our race is a single organism, always growing and branching--which must be pruned regularly to be healthy. This necessity need not be argued; 	anyone with eyes can see that any organism which grows without limit always dies within &quot;its own poisons. 	The only rational question is whether pruning is best done before or after birth. Being an incurable 	sentimentalist I favor the former of these methods--killing makes me queasy, even when it&quot;s a case of &quot;He&quot;s 	dead and I&quot;m alive and that&quot;s the way I wanted it to be.&quot; But this may be a matter of taste. Some shamans 	think that it is better to be killed in a war, or to die in childbirth, or to starve in misery, than never to have 	lived at all. They may be right.

							<p class="content">The difference between science and the fuzzy subjects is that science requires reasoning, while those other subjects merely require scholarship.  Copulation is spiritual in essence--or it is merely friendly exercise. On second thought, strike out &quot;merely.&quot; Copulation is not &quot;merely&quot;--even when it is just a happy pastime for two strangers. But copulation at its spiritual best is so much more than physical coupling that it is different in kind as well as in degree.  The saddest feature of homosexuality is not that it is &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;sinful&quot; or even that it can&#39;t lead to progeny--but that it is more difficult to reach through it this spiritual union. Not impossible--but the cards are stacked against it.  But most sorrowfully--many people never achieve spiritual sharing even with the help of male-female advantage; they are condemned to wander through life alone.

							<p class="content">The profession of shaman has many advantages. It offers high status with a safe livelihood free of work in the dreary, sweaty sense. In most societies it offers legal privileges and immunities not granted to other men. But it is hard to see how a man who has been given a mandate from on High to spread tidings of joy to all mankind can be seriously interested  in taking up a collection to pay his salary; it causes one to suspect that the shaman is on the moral level of any  other man.  But it&quot;s lovely work if you can stomach it.

							<p class="content">A whore should be judged by the same criteria as other, professionals offering services for pay--such as dentists, lawyers, hairdressers, physicians, plumbers, etc. Is she professionally competent&quot; Does she give good measure&quot;  Is she honest with her clients&quot;  It is possible that the percentage of honest and competent whores is higher than that of plumbers and much higher than that of lawyers. And enormously higher than that of professors.

							<p class="content">Beware of the &quot;Black Swan&quot; fallacy. Deductive logic is tautological; there is no way to get a new truth out of it, and it manipulates false statements as readily as true ones.  If you fail to remember this, it can trip you--with perfect logic. The designers of the earliest computers called this the &quot;Gigo Law,&quot; i.e., &quot;Garbage in, garbage out.&quot;

							<p class="content">On the planet Tranquille around KM849 (G-O) lives a little animal known as a &quot;knafn.&quot; It is herbivorous and has no natural enemies and is easily approached and may be petted	--sort of a six-legged puppy with scales. Stroking it is very pleasant; it wiggles its pleasure and broadcasts euphoria in some band that humans can detect. It&quot;s worth the trip.  Someday some bright boy will figure out how to record this broadcast, then some smart boy will see commercial angles--and not long after that it will be regulated and taxed. In the meantime I have faked that name and catalog  number; it is several thousand light-years off in another direction.  Selfish of me--

							<p class="content">Political tags--such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and. so forth--are never basic criteria. The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire.  The former are idealists acting from highest motives for the greatest good of the greatest number.  The latter are surly curmudgeons, suspicious and lacking in altruism.  But they are more comfortable neighbors than the other sort.

							<p class="content">Do not confuse &quot;duty&quot; with what other people expect of you; they are utterly different. Duty is a debt you owe yourself to fulfill obligations you have assumed voluntarily.  Paying that debt can entail anytbing from years of patient work to instant willingness to die. Difficult it may be, but the reward is self-respect.  But there is no reward at all for doing what other people expect of you, and to do so is not merely difficult, but impossible. It is easier to deal with a footpad than it is with the leech who wants &quot;just a few minutes of your time, please--this won&quot;t take long.&quot; Time is your total capital, and the minutes of your life are painfully few. If you allow yourself to fall into the vice of agreeing to such requests, they quickly snowball to the point where these parasites will use up 100 percent of your time--and squawk for more!  So learn to say No--and to be rude about it when necessary. Otherwise you will not have time to carry out your duty, or to do your own work, and certainly no time for love and happiness. The termites will nibble away your life and leave none of it for you.  (This rule does not mean that you must not do a favor for a friend, or even a stranger. But let the choice be yours. Don&#39;t do it because it is &quot;expected&quot; of you.)
